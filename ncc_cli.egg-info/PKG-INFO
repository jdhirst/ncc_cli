Description: # ncc_cli
        NextCloud / ownCloud Command-Line Client
        
        Overview
        ========
        Just a basic command-line client for NextCloud and ownCloud based servers. This is my project with Python so if you notice any bugs or would like to provide help, please let me know!
        
        Installation
        ===========
        #### pip:
        ncc_cli has been added to pip, so you can simply execute the following:
        >    pip install ncc-cli
        
        #### manual:
        Alternatively, you can install the utility manually, but first you will need to install the following dependancies:
        >humanize
        >tzdm
        >yaspin
        >texttable
        >pyocclient
        
        Now you have all of the dependancies installed, you can simply clone the ncc_cli git repo and execute the following:
        >    ./setup.py

        Libraries
        =========
        This utility uses the pyocclient library and a couple of other libraries for visual indications, human readable numbers, progress bars etc. Much thanks to all of the developers of their respective libraries.
